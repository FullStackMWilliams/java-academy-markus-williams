    // NOTES: Coding is not just about solving equations, your code should be legible and meaningful.

//  Questions:

        // 1.) Create two variables to represent the salary for Bob and Gray, name them  bobSalary and graySalary.
         // Create a new variable named highestSalary.
         // Determine whose salary is greater using Math.max() and store the answer in highestSalary.
         // Set the initial salary variables to any value you want.
         // Print the answer (i.e " The highest salary is...)
