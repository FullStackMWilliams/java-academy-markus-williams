//                  Exercise 3

// Notes: Create a Java Application named BasicCalculator that reads in two floating point numbers and then asks the user whether they want to add, subtract, multiply, or divide the two numbers.
// Notes: For this exercise, only code the questions. We won't calculate add, subtract, multiply, or divide.
// For this exercise, always multiply.

        Scanner readMeBot = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print( );

//  Step 1

        // 1.) Perform the requested operation and display the results

        // Enter the first number: 5
        // Enter the second number: 12
        // Select multiply
