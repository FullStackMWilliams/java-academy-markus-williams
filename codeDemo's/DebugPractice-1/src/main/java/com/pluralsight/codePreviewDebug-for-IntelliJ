 Are you having trouble with project turning off preview after adding a new project?
 Great im here to help.
 First locate the file that no longer previews
 check if pom.xml has M logo if not proceeded to the following steps
 If not intellij just needs you to add the pom file back in the Maven window
 open the Maven icon and select add file
 in the code file selected locate your pom.xml file
 select the pom.xml file of the code you want to preview
 add it to Maven and Done.
